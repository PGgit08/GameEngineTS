# Asset Loading System (IDEA):
- Initially create DefaultRenderer and set it as the current Renderer. After load Asset Renderers and if one is "default", set it as current Renderer.

- Create Shaders and add them. Then load all of them through ShaderManager.

- Load custom Meshes from OBJ asset files (**NOT HERE YET**)

- After loading that, initially create DefaultScene and set it as the current Scene. After load Scenes and if one is "default" set it as current Renderer.

- **Prefabs should also exist and Entity Spawn / Destroy**
