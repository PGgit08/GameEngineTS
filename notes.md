# Asset Loading System (IDEA):
- Initially look for Renderers, and create them. If they are set to as "default" Renderers, immediatly set them as current Renderer.
- Load ShaderManager
- Load custom Meshes from OBJ asset files (**NOT HERE YET**)
- After loading that, load Scenes. Once again, Initially create the scene, then if they are set to as "default", immediatly set them as current Scene.
- **Prefabs should also exist and entity Spawn / Destroy**
